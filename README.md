# Real-ESRGAN

## Abstract
&emsp; You can use this [Real-ESRGAN] to train and test yourself.
The code presented in this repository can perform super-resolution on variety of noises as well as the official Real-ESRGAN.
This function is achieved by learning on low-resolution images with various noises applied.
The generators, discriminators, and loss functions are exactly the same as in the official SRGAN, allowing for a more sophisticated super-resolution experience.
